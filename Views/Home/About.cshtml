            <h1 class="section-title">Our Story</h1>
            <p>Founded in 2010, Fast Food started as a small family-owned restaurant with a simple mission: to serve delicious, high-quality food using the freshest ingredients, all delivered quickly to our customers.</p>
            <p>What began as a single location has now grown into multiple restaurants across the city, but our commitment to quality and service remains unchanged. We believe that fast food doesn't have to compromise on taste or nutrition.</p>
            <p>Every day, our team works hard to source the finest ingredients, prepare meals with care, and deliver them promptly to your doorstep or serve them in our welcoming restaurants.</p>
